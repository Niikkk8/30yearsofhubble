                    <p>The Hubble Space Telescope (HST or Hubble) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth
                        orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of
                        NASA's Great Observatories. It features a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) mirror and five main instruments
                        that observe in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic
                        spectrum. Its orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely
                        high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes.
                        Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as determining the rate
                        of expansion of the universe.</p>
                    <p>Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923, and the Hubble telescope was funded and built in
                        the 1970s by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space
                        Agency. Hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. It was
                        launched in 1990, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting in spherical
                        aberration. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the
                        telescope, including all five of the main instruments. Hubble is the visible light telescope in
                        NASA's Great Observatories program, with other parts of the spectrum covered by the Compton
                        Gamma Ray Observatory, Chandra X-ray Observatory, and Spitzer Space Telescope. The James Webb
                        Space Telescope (JWST) was launched on December 25, 2021, with the Nancy Grace Roman Space
                        Telescope due to follow in 2027.</p>

                    <p>The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is responsible for the scientific operation of the
                        telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. It was established in 1981 after a
                        power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. STScI is responsible for
                        scheduling observations for the telescope, which is in a low-Earth orbit and is occulted by the
                        Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit. The solar avoidance angle is about 50°, to keep
                        sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out
                        of the FGSs, and scattered light from entering the instruments.</p>
                    <p>If the FGSs are turned off, the Moon and Earth can be observed. There is a continuous viewing
                        zone (CVZ) within roughly 24° of Hubble's orbital poles, in which targets are not occulted for
                        long periods. Hubble's orbit is in low Earth orbit at an altitude of 540 kilometers (340 mi) and
                        an inclination of 28.5°. Observation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in
                        advance, as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance the target would be unobservable by
                        the time it was due to be observed. Engineering support for HST is provided by NASA and
                        contractor personnel at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, 48 km (30 mi)
                        south of the STScI. Hubble's operation is monitored 24 hours per day by four teams of flight
                        controllers.</p>
